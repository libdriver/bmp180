## LibDriver BMP180

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/bmp180/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The BMP180 is the function compatible successor of the BMP085, a new generation of high precision digital pressure sensors for consumer applications.The ultra-low power, low voltage electronics of the BMP180 is optimized for use in mobile phones, PDAs, GPS navigation devices and outdoor equipment. With a low altitude noise of merely 0.25m at fast conversion time, the BMP180 offers superior performance. The IIC interface allows for easy system integration with a microcontroller.The BMP180 is based on piezo-resistive technology for EMC robustness, high accuracy and linearity as well as long term stability.

LibDriver BMP180 is a full-featured driver of BMP180 launched by LibDriver.It provides temperature, pressure reading and mode setting functions and so on. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver BMP180 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver BMP180 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver BMP180 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver BMP180 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver BMP180 offline document.

/datasheet includes BMP180 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_bmp180_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature;
uint32_t pressure;

res = bmp180_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    bmp180_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = bmp180_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (uint32_t *)&pressure);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bmp180_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    bmp180_interface_debug_print("bmp180: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    bmp180_interface_debug_print("bmp180: pressure is %dPa.\n", pressure);
    
    ...
        
}

...

(void)bmp180_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
